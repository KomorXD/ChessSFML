# ChessSFML
Simple Chess program I amde for my university assignment.  
You can load pre-config from file with FEN format and play 1 vs 1.  
There is only 1 game mode, classic 1v1. 
Back when I made this I had no idea about proper project/repo structure so I don't guarantee it will work if you pull it.
